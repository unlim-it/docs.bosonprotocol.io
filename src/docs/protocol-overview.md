# Protocol overview

Boson Protocol enables smart contracts to perform on-chain financial transfers 
in line with the off-chain, often physical, delivery of goods and services. The 
ultimate goal is to do it in an atomic and autonomous manner - any other way 
raises security/trust issues and casts doubts on using blockchain in the first 
place.

The base of Boson Protocol is implemented and enforced in smart contracts. 
There are also keeper services running as self-hosted scripts that help actors 
for a better UX and can be run by anyone, e.g. scheduled transactions. Lastly, 
there is a developer experience component whose aim is to help developers use 
Boson Protocol, and it currently consists of a reference P2P app and 
accompanying documentation.

The protocol will progressively grow in complexity as well as the list of its 
components and we are looking forward to find the best paths together with 
other projects in the space.
