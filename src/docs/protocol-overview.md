# Protocol overview

Boson Protocol enables smart contracts to perform on-chain financial transfers
coordinated with the off-chain, often physical, delivery of goods and services.
The ultimate goal is to do it in an atomic and autonomous manner - any other way
raises security/trust issues and raises questions about why you would need a
blockchain.

The base layer of Boson Protocol is implemented and enforced in smart contracts.
There are also keeper services running as self-hosted scripts that offer an
improved UX and can be run by anyone, e.g. scheduled transactions.

The protocol will progressively grow in complexity, as will the list of its
components, and we are looking forward to finding the best paths in
collaboration with other projects in the space.
