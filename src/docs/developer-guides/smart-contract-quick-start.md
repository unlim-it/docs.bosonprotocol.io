# Smart contract quickstart

There are convenience tools for local development, testing and linting that are 
documented in detail on the code repository.

Local development gets you up and running with one command.

Testing: `Truffle`, where the automated testing script starts a local `Ganache`.

Coverage: `solidity-coverage`.

Linting: `solhint` for contracts, `eslint` for tests.

Formatting: `prettier-solidity` for contracts, `prettier` for tests.
