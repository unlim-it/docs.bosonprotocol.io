# Smart contract quickstart

There are convenient tools for local development, testing and linting that are 
documented in detail in the README [contracts repository](https://github.com/bosonprotocol/contracts):

Testing: `Truffle`, where the automated testing script starts a local `Ganache`.

Coverage: `solidity-coverage`.

Linting: `solhint` for contracts, `eslint` for tests.

Formatting: `prettier-solidity` for contracts, `prettier` for tests.

We have made it as easy as possible to get up and running with a single command.
