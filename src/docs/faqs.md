# Frequently Asked Questions

First, a small note: your question may not be here. Why? Because we've recently 
open sourced this work. That means that questions haven't been asked, well, 
frequently. This means that if you have a question, and it's not here, we 
encourage you to ask it, and we'll add it here. 

### How can I add my question?

The best way to add a question is to open a Pull Request to either 
[the docs repo](https://github.com/bosonprotocol/docs) or in 
[the repo for this site](https://github.com/bosonprotocol/docs.bosonprotocol.io) 

The second best way is to open an issue in any repository, clarifying that you 
are asking a question and not filing a bug or suggesting a feature. We will 
label those issues and add our answers here. The more questions you ask, the 
more useful this document will be.

The third best way is to ask on our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/BosonProtocol). 
If you can, mention that the question might be good for the FAQ.

There is no bad way to ask for a question to be here.
