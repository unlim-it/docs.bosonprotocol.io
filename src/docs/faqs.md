# Frequently Asked Questions

First, a small note: your question may not be here. Why? Because we've recently open sourced this work. That means that questions haven't been asked, well, frequently. This means that if you have a question, and it's not here, we encourage you to ask it, and we'll add it here.

- [When is your next token sale?](#when-is-your-next-token-sale)

### How can I add my question?

If you have a question, but not the answer, the best place to ask it is on our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/BosonProtocol) channel. Another place you could ask questions is in any of the relevant repositories - however, clarify you're asking a question and not reporting a bug or proposing a feature. Mentioning that your question would be good for the FAQ, no matter where you ask it, is a good idea, as that highlights that answers should be presented in a format which works for others, too.

The best way to add a question to the FAQ for which you already have an answer is to open a Pull Request to
[the repo for this site](https://github.com/bosonprotocol/docs.bosonprotocol.io).

Ultimately, there is no bad way to ask for a question, and we would love to have questions which are actually frequently asked here.

## What is Boson Protocol?

Boson Protocol is three things:

- A protocol, comprised of modular components, which focuses on exchanging NFTs.
- A foundation, currently funded by an external company, Redeemeum, which works on the wider Bosom Protocol ecosystem.
- A wider community of developers working on the protocol.

## What is Redeemeum?

Redeemeum is a company that the Boson Protocol team has set up to aquire funding and to directly employ developers. The goal is that this company will work on tools and systems which contribute to the Boson Protocol ecosystem, and that it will eventually be one of many such companies - similar to Ethereum and the Ethereum Foundation, or Protocol Labs and Filecoin.

## When is your next token sale?

These docs concern the Boson Protocol codebase, not any token sales on top of it. For those questions, you'd best go to our [Telegram](https://t.me/bosonprotocol).
