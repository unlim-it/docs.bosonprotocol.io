# Frequently asked questions

First, a small note: your question may not be here. Why? Because we've only
recently open-sourced this work. That means that questions haven't been asked,
well, frequently. This also means that if you have a question and it's not here,
we encourage you to ask it, and we'll add it here.

## How can I add my question?

If you have a question, but not the answer, the best place to ask it is on our
[Gitter](https://gitter.im/BosonProtocol) channel. Another place you could ask
questions is in any of the relevant repositories - however, clarify you're
asking a question and not reporting a bug or proposing a feature. Mentioning
that your question would be good for the FAQ, no matter where you ask it, is a
good idea, as that highlights that answers should be presented in a format which
works for others, too.

The best way to add a question to the FAQ for which you already have an answer
is to open a pull request to
[the repo for this site](https://github.com/bosonprotocol/docs.bosonprotocol.io).

Ultimately, there is no bad way to ask for a question to be added here, and we
would love to have questions which are actually frequently asked.

## What is Boson Protocol?

A decentralized infrastructure for enabling  autonomous commercial exchanges of anyThing, specifically off-chain items.  Boson is a peer-to-peer system which replicates the benefits of a market intermediary, without the disbenefits of centralized systems.

## Is Boson a platform for minting NFTs?

No. Boson Commitment tokens are a type of NFT encoded with game theory that represent a promise to redeem a particular item. While it is entirely possible for buyers and sellers to agree to transact existing NFTs using Boson, the protocol’s real power comes from its ability to treat off-chain assets in the same way as on-chain assets: in other words, solving the physical redemption problem.

## What can I exchange with Boson commitment tokens?

Project Multiverse is the all-encompassing term we use to describe Boson’s Generic Exchange Mechanism. The idea of a Generic Exchange Mechanism is to create a frictionless system that does not distinguish between digital and physical goods and services. For example, imagine an event where tickets are issued in the form of Commitment NFTs, which also confer the right to physical swag and collectibles, plus also a video of the event.

By establishing a generic standard for the exchange mechanism and introducing common interfaces to govern those exchanges we allow Boson Protocol to power any kind of commercial exchange.

## What does the BOSON token do?

The $BOSON token is the core economic unit of the Boson ecosystem. Growth in the value of the token is driven by establishing an economic flywheel, following the [dCommerce sustainability loop](https://medium.com/bosonprotocol/introducing-the-dcommerce-sustainability-loop-1d72026636d0).

## What is the Boson DAO?

The dCommerce DAO will fund projects that build core Boson Protocol software, applications, tools and integrations, as well as ensuring the growth of the ecosystem via temporary growth policies, such as supply and demand farming.

Revenue generation from projects and initiatives is funnelled back into the DAO, with a fraction of all revenue being used to buy and burn $BOSON. To get the “economic flywheel” going, part of the “network rewards fund” is used to fund the dCommerce DAO until it is self sustaining.
The perpetual funding of the dCommerce DAO is ensured through a minimally extractive fee on transaction coordination and data monetization facilitated by Boson Protocol. $BOSON token holders will govern the dCommmerce DAO. For more info see our [Governance design principles](https://medium.com/bosonprotocol/governance-design-principles-c7565492512) and $BOSON ecosystem value flows articles.

## What is an arbitrator?

Arbitration is a different word for dispute management.

"Arbitration is a procedure in which a dispute is submitted, by agreement of the parties, to one or more arbitrators who make a binding decision on the dispute."

The challenge that Boson Protocol is taking is automating and thus decentralising arbitration with minimised human intervention.

## Who is Boson’s target market?

Everyone in the world who wants to buy or sell anyThing, whatever and wherever it is. The Protocol is capable of facilitating arbitration-minimized exchange for anyThing, whether digital or physical. 

## What is the dCommerce stack?

Boson Protocol’s vision is to enable a decentralized commerce ecosystem by funding and enabling the development of a stack of specialist applications to disrupt, demonopolize and democratize commerce.

Hence we are building out a collectively maintained infrastructure made up of smaller, composable services for commerce: open, transparent, minimally extractive, and resistant to capture. Read more about the dCommerce stack [here](https://medium.com/bosonprotocol/the-dcommerce-stack-disrupting-commerce-with-a-web-3-ecosystem-1f0156a8afa4).

## Which blockchain will you use to build Boson Protocol?

The goal of Boson Protocol is to be a pluggable web3 component. We are blockchain agnostic as long as the base-layer meet our requirements of security, decentralization and scalability.

## How will Boson circumvent high gas fees?

No specifics are available at this stage, but many scaling and gas reduction options are being considered. Boson Protocol is chain agnostic and will pursue the options that are best suited to the project and community when the opportunity arises. 

A cross-chain/interoperable future for the ecosystem is definitely the plan.

## How do I contribute to the project?
