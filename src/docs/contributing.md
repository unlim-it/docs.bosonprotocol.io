# Contributing

Boson Protocol is open source. That means that the code is permissively licensed
so that anyone can see, copy, distribute, use and share the code. More than
that - while it means that Boson Protocol follows the norms and values of open
source culture - we're interested in not just creating code, but working on it
collaboratively with others. Boson Protocol is being built by a community of
developers. Contributors are first-order citizens in the Boson Protocol
universe; we're excited that you're reading this and interested in contributing
to the project.

There are several ways to get involved in the Boson Protocol ecosystem. First,
we encourage deep dives into the code, and welcome both pull requests and issues
from anyone in the community. If you have a question, a bug report or a feature
request, open an issue and share your thoughts. We also have an active
[Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/BosonProtocol) which you can use to talk to
core developers synchronously, especially for questions which feel too small for
an issue.
