# Contributing

Boson Protocol is open source. That means that the code is permissively licensed
so that anyone can see, copy, distribute, use and share the code. More than
that - while it means that Boson Protocol follows the norms and values of open
source culture - we're interested in not just creating code, but working on it
collaboratively with others. Boson Protocol is being built by a community of
developers. Contributors are first-order citizens in the Boson Protocol
universe; we're excited that you're reading this and interested in contributing
to the project.

There are several ways to get involved in the Boson Protocol ecosystem. First,
we encourage deep dives into the code, and welcome both pull requests and issues
from anyone in the community. If you have a question, a bug report or a feature
request, open an issue and share your thoughts. We also have an active
[Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/BosonProtocol) which you can use to talk to
core developers synchronously, especially for questions which feel too small for
an issue.

## Opening issues

We welcome any issues related to Boson Protocol, on any repository which accepts
issues. Generally, we prefer issues which refer to bugs or which are requesting
features. At this stage in the development, support issues are also welcomed, as
they help us improve our docs. So are general questions, as we can use these to
feed content to the [FAQ](/faqs.md). If asking a general question, we encourage
you to suggest that it be added to the FAQ, or open a PR yourself adding it
there.

## Opening pull requests

All PRs must pass the tests and linting standards for any repository in which
they are opened. We have an extensive CI pipeline that keeps everything running
well, which depends upon tests passing.

## Community calls

We are shortly going to have community calls at a regular cadence. These will be
public, recorded and put online for others to watch at their leisure. We will
announce these calls in the
[bosonprotocol/community](https://github.com/bosonprotocol/community)
repository; watch it in order to be notified!

## Roadmap planning

One of the most interesting topics we hope to talk about in the community calls
is our long-term roadmap. We're actively interested in having community members
as drivers of the protocol. The best way to become involved in our process is to
join the community calls and to suggest partnerships, integrations, or features
which will lead to a more robust, useful ecosystem for Boson Protocol.

## Path to Maintainership

As part of the process of becoming integrated in the community, it will
eventually make sense to make community members part of the Boson Protocol
GitHub organization with access rights and privileges. While we haven't yet
onboarded non-Boson Protocol users to maintainers, that's just because we're
new. If you feel that you, or (even better) someone else in the community, should
have maintainer rights to a project, reach out to the core team on Gitter or
privately to talk about next steps forward. We will eventually codify this into
a more robust process.

## Join the team

Another way of becoming a maintainer is to join the Boson Protocol team
directly. Sound fun? Take a gander at our
[job postings](https://github.com/bosonprotocol/jobs)!

## Code of Conduct

All of our interactions are governed by our
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/bosonprotocol/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Please read and abide by it; you signify that you support and will follow it by
interacting in any Boson Protocol space. This helps makes the entire ecosystem
more safe, diverse, and equitable for everyone.
