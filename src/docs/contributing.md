# Contributing

Boson Protocol is open source. That means that anyone can see, copy, distribute, 
use, and share the code. But open source isn't just a noun - it's a verb. Boson 
Protocol is being built by a community of developers. Contributors are 
first-order citizens in the Boson Protocol universe; we're excited that you're 
reading this and interested in contributing to the project.
