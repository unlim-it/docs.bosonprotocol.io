# Roadmap

Leveraging the most battle-tested and widely adopted blockchain ecosystem, we
started by building on Ethereum. This enables us the fastest time-to-deploy
and provides access to a large user base. Further in the future, going
with Ethereum gives us the option to scale horizontally, if need be, to
potentially multiple Ethereum-based Cosmos zones, a.k.a. Ethermint, which are
attracting an increasingly wider audience. Spreading to other EVM-based
networks, such as RSK, also remains an option. In principle, we remain open to
new arrivals, such as Solana, but have put Ethereum first and are researching
some of its novel scaling approaches, predominantly rollups.

We have a short-term plan to build and deploy an MVP in 2020, consisting of two
major parts: the minimum viable core of Boson Protocol and its integration with
the first customer(s). The technological stack will consist of three components: 
the main business logic on Ethereum, a comprehensive SDK to interact with it, a
reference back-office client for merchants and reference mobile app for
end-users.

Thus, our 1-2 year plan is to build on top of Ethereum mainnet, with maximally 
optimized components and implementing a logic that updates the blockchain state 
as minimally as possible, using tight data packing, batch processing, eventual 
rollups, etc. Our 2+ year plan is to potentially explore other blockchain 
networks, also taking into account that the goal of Boson Protocol is to be a 
pluggable web3 component, that is, to be generally interoperable.
Compatibility with multiple blockchains presents a challenge on its own and is
especially delicate in terms of coordination over heterogeneous partitions. We
are researching several approaches - most notably, 0x is spearheading this space
with the EXTCODEHASH “metamodel” (must watch: <https://youtu.be/iU0FkWpFyUY> )

For questions on the roadmap and the future of Boson Protocol, we encourage
hard-hitting questions in the [Gitter](https://gitter.im/BosonProtocol).
