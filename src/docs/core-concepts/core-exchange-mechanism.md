# Core exchange mechanism

The core exchange mechanism can be viewed as a decision support system which
coordinates exchange, governs reversals and handles the main load of disputes in
order to significantly reduce arbitration cost and friction versus arbitrated
protocols. The mechanism is designed as a sequential game in which Buyer and
Seller commit deposits up-front, promoting fair behavior.

## Towards an ideal arbitrated system

Boson Protocol implements a 2-sided deposit structure within a sequential game,
which automates the mediation of disputes and mitigates reversal losses by
ensuring that both agents are incentivized to behave fairly. However, first we
conceive of an ideal system which is highly automated, has minimum viable
functionality for coordinating commercial exchange, and in which disputes and
reversals are mediated by an ideal arbitrator.

The objective function of the system is:

**_to maximize the supply of no-complaint voucher redemptions._**

The core exchange process proceeds as follows:

- **Offer**: This involves a seller listing an item; thereby specifying the
  item's price and deposit amounts, in addition to the desired payment currency
  and the listing's validity period. The Seller's deposit is then placed in
  escrow.
- **Commit**: This involves a buyer committing to purchase an item; thereby
  paying the seller-defined deposit and the item price, placing both in escrow.

Deposit amounts are variable and form part of the commercial terms of the
exchange. Deposit levels are proposed by the Seller and then accepted by the
Buyer. It is possible that similar underlying items could be offered via their
respective vouchers, but with differing Buyer and Seller deposit levels,
indicating different levels of commitment to redemption and quality. We
elaborate on this below.

## Practical atomicity

For the happy path, at point of exchange the buyer unilaterally signs a
redemption transaction in return for the seller transferring the item. If, and
only if, the redemption transaction is signed, the system will transfer the
payment amount to the seller. We refer to this as _practical atomicity_, where
_practical_ refers to the assumption that a buyer who signs the redemption
receives the item. The transaction is _practical_ rather than absolute, because
it is as atomic as handing over cash for goods. With a cash transaction the
Seller could take the cash and not deliver the service, but this is not a
practical concern. Therefore, we contend that this is atomic enough for most
commercial purposes.

## Transaction reversibility

Due to the requirement for atomicity, in addition to the fact that not all
promises will be fulfilled, transactions require the property of reversibility.
As a consequence, the system enables a Buyer to trigger a refund transaction as
well as automatically reversing transactions at expiry of their validity period.
The options available after the commit stage are:

- **Redeem**: This involves the buyer redeeming their purchased item (i.e.
  gaining ownership of said item). At this point, the payment amount is released
  to the Seller.
- **Refund**: This involves the buyer triggering a refund request. Payment is
  then returned to the buyer.
- **Wait**: No action taken and the validity period expires. Payment is then
  returned to the Buyer.

However, transaction reversibility introduces the challenges of reversal costs
and dispute mediation identified in the original Bitcoin White Paper. The
example of buying a used car illustrates these challenges.

Take the following example:

Alice views a used car online, which is offered for sale at a cost of $10,000
and with 100,000 miles on the clock. Alice makes an offer to Bob of $10,000,
which Bob accepts. Alice, who lives in London, agrees to travel the following
weekend to complete the exchange with Bob, who lives in Leeds. If Alice fails to
arrive in Leeds to complete the exchange, Bob has missed out on other
opportunities for exchange, therefore incurring a loss. Conversely, if Alice
arrives in Leeds and Bob has already sold the car, then Alice incurs a loss.

## Dispute mediation

If buyer and seller beneficiaries make conflicting claims on real-world events,
then smart contracts cannot determine which version of reality to trust. Taking
our previous example: if Alice arrives in Leeds to complete the exchange and
detects that the car has actually driven 200,000 miles, Alice has a quality
dispute. This, and the above, problems are addressed by the mechanism:

The buyer has the option to unilaterally report quality (in addition to other)
issues as follows:

- **Complain**: A Buyer can only complain after either redeeming, refunding or
  waiting for the validity period to expire. The decision to do this will affect
  the final deposits payout.

The seller has the option to address issues as follows:

- **Cancel or Fault**: The Seller can choose to cancel the transaction at any
  point. However if this is done after the Buyer redeems, then this is
  considered an admission of fault. This decision will affect the final deposit
  payouts.

## Summary

The variables that are part of the mechanism are:

- price the buyer is willing to pay for the item, denoted by $$p$$.
- deposit the seller is putting to the mechanism $$M$$, denoted by $$D_S$$.
- deposit the buyer is putting to the mechanism $$M$$, denoted by $$D_B$$.

Therefore, in this setting, there are $$2^3=8$$ final states the contract can
observe. Example state is denoted by $$s$$. Contract has to specify
$$8\times 2=16$$ transfers, $$2$$ transfers to players for each state $$s$$. One
transfer to the seller, denoted by $$t^{S}_s$$, and one to the buyer, denoted by
$$t^{B}_s$$. $$T$$ denotes the set of transfers.

Note that the total number of _real_ states is more than $$8$$ since there are
hidden actions of the players.

Here, the the green lines denote subgame-perfect equilibrium moves. The red
lines denote off-equilibrium moves. Note that the first move is not observed by
the mechanism. That is, the states in the left and right subtrees are the same,
from the perspective of the smart contract.

In the first move of the seller, H corresponds to sending a high-quality item,
while L corresponds to sending a low-quality item.

In the second move, the buyer plays either redeem (R) or no redeem (refund or
expire - RfE). In the third move, the buyer complains (C) or does not complain
(NC). Finally, the seller acknowledges a fault (CF) or does not acknowledge the
fault (NC).

Transfers to players are:

| state $$s$$ | $$t_s^B$$        | $$t_s^S$$     |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| 000         | $$p$$            | $$D_S$$       |
| 001         | $$p+D_B+0.5D_S$$ | $$0.5D_S$$    |
| 010         | $$p$$            | $$0$$         |
| 011         | $$p+0.5D_S+D_B$$ | $$0.25D_S$$   |
| 100         | $$D_B$$          | $$p+D_S$$     |
| 101         | $$D_B+0.5D_S$$   | $$p+0.5D_S$$  |
| 110         | $$0$$            | $$p$$         |
| 111         | $$0.5D_S+D_B$$   | $$p+0.25D_S$$ |

The first bit stands for redemption, where $$1$$ means that the redemption was
performed by the buyer and $$0$$ if it was not. The second bit stands for
complaint, where $$1$$ corresponds to the buyer complaint and $$0$$ corresponds
to no complaint. The third bit corresponds to Cancel or Fault, where $$1$$
stands for Cancel or Fault and $$0$$ for no Cancel or Fault. Note that there are
$$p+D_S+D_B$$ total amount locked up. If transfers paid to players do not sum up
to that number, it means that the rest goes to Boson protocol. In the current
implementation there are 2 additional states, as CF is allowed to be called any
time. If it is called right before buyer's committment - nothing happens -
seller gets his/her deposit back. If it is called right after buyer's
committment - seller gets $$0.5D_S$$ back and buyer gets $$0.5D_S+D_B+p$$.
