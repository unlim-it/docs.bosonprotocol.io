# Introduction

Welcome! Boson Protocolâ€™s vision is to enable a decentralized commerce ecosystem 
by funding and enabling the development of a stack of specialized applications 
to disrupt, demonopolize and democratize commerce. Boson Protocol enables this 
via an open tokenized economy of Things which:

1. Automates the redemption of digital rights for physical assets using NFTs 
encoded with game theory.
2. Disrupts e-commerce platforms by tokenizing Things and their data within a 
liquid digital market, built on DeFi.

This is enabled by a design with five modular and substitutable components. 
First a commitment to perform a future commercial exchange represented as a 
tokenized voucher. Second, a core mechanism for autonomous coordination of 
commercial exchange. Third, a token model for incentivizing actors, and 
capturing and distributing value. Fourth, a Web3 data marketplace for 
monetizing data. And finally, an evolving governance system for directing and 
controlling the protocol throughout its lifecycle.

The Boson project documentation offers all the necessary resources to learn 
about Boson, the software and the tools to leverage the protocol. If you are 
new to Boson, you might want to check out 
[Protocol Overview](/protocol-overview) or the [FAQs](/faqs) first.
