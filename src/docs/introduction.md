# Introduction

Welcome! Boson Protocolâ€™s vision is to provide for a decentralized commerce
ecosystem by funding and enabling the development of a stack of specialized
applications to disrupt, demonopolize and democratize commerce. Boson Protocol
enables this via an open tokenized economy of Things which:

1. Automates the redemption of digital rights for physical assets using NFTs and
   carefully-designed deposit transfers.
2. Disrupts e-commerce platforms by tokenizing Things and their data within a
   liquid digital market, built on DeFi.

This is enabled by a design with five modular and substitutable components. The
first of these components is a commitment to perform a future commercial
exchange represented as a tokenized voucher. Second, a core mechanism for
autonomous coordination of commercial exchange. Third, a token model for
incentivizing actors, and for capturing and distributing value. Fourth, a Web3
data marketplace for monetizing data. And finally, an evolving governance system
for directing and controlling the protocol throughout its lifecycle.

The Boson project documentation offers all the necessary resources to learn
about Boson, the software and the tools to leverage the protocol. If you are new
to Boson, you might want to check out the
[protocol overview](/protocol-overview/) or the [FAQs](/faqs) first.

For a high-level overview, see the
[light paper blog post](https://medium.com/bosonprotocol/boson-protocol-light-paper-released-6b0bf00e4238).

## Developer community

If you're reading this for the first time, welcome.

Boson Protocol is both a protocol, a foundation, and a community. We've worked
hard to ensure that the code and technical specifications for the protocol are
available, here on GitHub. As a foundation, we're hiring developers to work on
the code and working with partner organizations to ensure that the ecosystem
grows. As a community, we're interested in building tools together, no matter
where you're from. Boson Protocol is dedicated to open source as our primary
methodology: whatever we can work on in the open, we will, and we want to ensure
that our community is welcoming, awesome, and that you (yes, you) have a say in
its future and governance.

All of our repositories will be opened for issues and pull requests. Right now,
we're putting the last touches on the main contracts repository, as well as two
reference apps which will showcase how to use Boson Protocol. We're excited to
share these with you! Watch this space.

Further, we're working on having regular community calls to talk about our
roadmaps and future work. We also maintain a developer community on
[Gitter](https://gitter.im/BosonProtocol/community). You can find out more about
how to contribute, including our process for pull request approvals and our
[Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct/).
