# Introduction

Welcome! Boson Protocolâ€™s vision is to provide for a decentralized commerce 
ecosystem by funding and enabling the development of a stack of specialized 
applications to disrupt, demonopolize and democratize commerce. Boson Protocol 
enables this via an open tokenized economy of Things which:

1. Automates the redemption of digital rights for physical assets using NFTs 
encoded with game theory.
2. Disrupts e-commerce platforms by tokenizing Things and their data within a 
liquid digital market, built on DeFi.

This is enabled by a design with five modular and substitutable components. 
The first of these components is a commitment to perform a future commercial 
exchange represented as a tokenized voucher. Second, a core mechanism for 
autonomous coordination of commercial exchange. Third, a token model for 
incentivizing actors, and for capturing and distributing value. Fourth, a Web3 
data marketplace for monetizing data. And finally, an evolving governance 
system for directing and controlling the protocol throughout its lifecycle.

The Boson project documentation offers all the necessary resources to learn 
about Boson, the software and the tools to leverage the protocol. If you are 
new to Boson, you might want to check out the
[protocol overview](/protocol-overview/) or the [FAQs](/faqs) first.

For a high-level overview, see the 
[lightpaper blog post](https://medium.com/bosonprotocol/boson-protocol-light-paper-released-6b0bf00e4238).

## Getting Started

The best way to start understanding the possibilities of the dApps you might 
want to build is to check out and run our reference app (linked below). 

- [Smart contract development](https://github.com/bosonprotocol/contracts)
- [Reference app](https://github.com/bosonprotocol/reference-frontend)

As well, we encourage you to join our community calls, to ask questions as you 
go along, and to join our community on 
[Gitter](https://gitter.im/BosonProtocol/community). Our goal is to make it 
easy for you to get up to scratch and coding with Boson, and the more we're 
able to iterate on this process, the better the ecosystem will be for 
everyone.

## Developer links

The Boson codebase is comprised of an ecosystem of open source components. For 
now, the most relevant code is in the following repository:

- [`contracts`](https://github.com/bosonprotocol/contracts)

To make it easier to understand how to interact with the contracts repo, we've 
built two reference applications: one for the backend, and the other for the 
front-end. These applications should be used as reference examples for 
interacting with Boson:

- [`reference-backend`](https://github.com/bosonprotocol/reference-backend)
- [`reference-frontend`](https://github.com/bosonprotocol/reference-frontend)

## Developer community

If you're reading this for the first time, welcome. 

Boson Protocol is both a protocol, a foundation, and a community. We've worked 
hard to ensure that the code and technical specifications for the protocol are 
available, here. As a foundation, we're hiring developers to work on the code 
and working with partner organizations to ensure that the ecosystem grows. As a 
community, we're interested in building tools together, no matter where you're 
coming from. Boson Protocol is dedicated to open source as our primary 
methodology: whatever we can work on in the open, we will, and we want to 
ensure that our community is welcoming, awesome, and that you (yes, you) have a 
say in its future and governance.

All of our repositories are open for issues and pull requests. Further, we're 
working on having regular community calls to talk about our roadmaps and future 
work. We also maintain a developer community on 
[Gitter](https://gitter.im/BosonProtocol/community). You can find out more 
about how to contribute, including our process for pull request approvals and 
our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/bosonprotocol/docs/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) 
[here](https://github.com/bosonprotocol/docs).
