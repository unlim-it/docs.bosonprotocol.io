# Boson Token engineering

Boson is a multi-aspect, multi-stakeholder situation. We must **design for
emergence**. We must come equipped with lenses to view multiple scopes. We must
identify leverage points in the system. We will describe the ecosystem value
flows in a common language using systems design and engineering. Our process is
adopted and adapted for token engineering. The Design Space in Token Models is
quite large. Every model is wrong, some are useful; a
[map is not the teritory](https://fs.blog/2015/11/map-and-territory/) - Hence,
at Boson Token Engineering, we start with the following:

1. Identify assumptions
2. Document assumptions
3. Track assumptions

The network's token shall **trace & represent the valueflows** of the network to
enable **coordination** at global scale. Depiction below from
[Outlier Ventures internal analysis](https://outlierventures.io/research/what-is-the-secret-to-building-valuable-tokens/)
shows the 2 components of token value, speculative, and fundamental.
_Engineering the speculative component is the dark side of the force_ -
[Ecosystem Valueflows Methodology](https://tokenengineeringcommunity.github.io/website/docs/academy-tmg1-ecosystem/)
focuses Token Engineering on the fundamental component. Once fundamental value
flows can be understood, designed, and engineered, then all that's needed to
trigger perpetual token value growth is the initialization of network effects &
sustainable governance.

Bosonprotocol invests significantly into maintaining one of the industries
strongest rosters for token engineering and maintains close relationships with
industry leaders in the space such as advisors Dr. Michael Zargham and Dr. Trent
McConaghy, two foundational researchers that have written seminal literature for
the field and pioneered world changing technology. Dr. Zargham is the founder of
blockcience and the inventor of cadCAD, and Dr. McConaghy, co-founder of ocean
protocol, and inventor of Tokenspice.

Dr. McConaghy's call for an emergent practice of token engineering and
systematic approach to such a discipline.

## Boson TE Methodology

The Token Engineering methodology practised at Boson is heavily influenced by
the work and research of our advisors. Our approach can be understood
essentially as the following four step process:

1. Write out **Goals** that we are trying to achieve.
2. Explore the **Design** space of tokenized mechanisms that can be composed
   towards achieving our goals - loop back to update our goals.
3. **Verification** of designs using numerical methods, modelling and
   simulation, data science and visualization - loop back to update designs
4. Expose mechanism levers and their resulting **Impact** on the bounds and
   likelihoods of ecosystem outcomes to empower decentralized decision making
   towards **Optimization** - loop back to update designs

### Goals for Boson Token Engineering

The objective of our ecosystem is to **maximize the number of quality voucher
redemptions** **facilitated by the boson protocol**. By injecting a small fee
into protocol usage, value capture is enabled. By routing value back into
ecosystem development, a virtuous cycle of sustainable growth is enabled for
boson and it's surrounding ecosystem. And by guardrailing a compliant path to
progressive decentralization, we can ensure the survival and continuous
improvement of an anti-fragile network to build and deploy the fair and
equitable decommerce stack. In summary, in addition to optimizing for the
ecosystem objective function as stated above, we are engineering for the
following goals:

- **Fair and equitable** distribution of ownership, value, and control.
- **Capture resistance** from centralized, extractive entities.
- **Regulatory compliance** with legitimate authorities.
- **Community ownership** and operation.

### Design space for Boson Token Engineering

The design space for Boson Token Engineering can be decomposed into three
primary categories, mechanism design, ecosystem value flows, and governance.
Each of which is covered in more detail in it's respective documentation page.
Here, we give a brief introduction to the stock and flow schema that is heavily
utilized by the Boson TE team to design ecosystem value flow models that are
later modelled and verified using cadCAD.

**Stock & Flows** The Stock & Flow is a system diagram representing the
relationship between different 'stocks' deposits of quantity and 'flows' the
change between them. You can think of a stock as a reserve that if time stops
will not move at all, a flow is the relationship between these different stocks
as time passes, if time stops there will be nothing in the flows and the stocks
will not change at all.

![Stock and Flows](/images/docs/tokenengineering/2.png)

#### Value Flows

The Value Flow is the stock and flow when applied to the value distribution in
an ecosystem. Value comes in from the inflows and exits through the outflows
through a network of stocks and flows.

#### The Boson Ecosystem ValueFlows

[Full detail on Boson Value flows](../core-concepts/ecosystem-value).

### Numerical Verification - Modelling and Simulation

Our token engineering methodology allows for seperation of concerns between
design teams and modelling teams. Ecosystem value flows are the final product of
the design team, and are handed of to the python gurus for model implementation,
simulations, and analysis. It's early stages for the boson token engineering
team, but here we present preliminary results boson ecosystem modelling.

Early considerations of capture resistance and equitable share of value for the
Boson network. Progressive decentralization allows for governance 'guard rails'
in the early stages of network development until network developers and
operators can ensure a majority possesion of the network after the initial
fundraising periods.

#### cadCAD in Context

cadCAD is an open-source Python library that lets you design, optimize, validate
and understand dynamical complex systems. It is useful because it allows
engineers to ask powerful what if questions, using simulation features like A/B
Tests, Parameter Sweeps or Monte Carlo Analysis. In our case, we use cadCAD for
simulating the movements Boson Value Flows over time. We can do this by assuming
the length of a Time Step, say 1 month, and specifying the number of Time Steps
that the system will run for, say 60 steps (5 years). The stocks act as
variables while the flows act as rates of change between them.

Here we model 'Phase-0' of the ecosystems value flows for the network. This is a
linear model in which boson network rewards are distributed strategically to
network developers and participants and to fund the production of community
ecosystem products, driving long-term value generation for boson and its
surrounding ecosystem.

![Boson Ecosystem Fund Distribution](/images/docs/tokenengineering/10.png)

Here we model 'Phase-1' of the ecosystems value flows for the network. In this
case, we have a supply of commitment token vouchers being minted by sellers.
Sellers are recruited to the platform by aggregators, of which we assume a
linear growth rate, but a non-linear growth in sellers. In this model, each
seller introduces a single type of product into the marketplace, represented by
a commitment token voucher set (ERC1155). Each product has a quantity available,
a price, an underlying quality, a popularity, and other attributes such as name.
We also assume that the number of buyers in the market will increase
non-linearly as the number of diverse products grows linearly. Complaints and
faults are sampled from a random distribution based off of the underlying value
of each commitment voucher item. As items result in complaints or faults, their
public popularity score decreases.

![Phase 1 Things 2](/images/docs/tokenengineering/12.png)

This work is extremely early stages, but has laid a framework for expansion of
ecosystem introspection. Next steps for the TE team include deeper dives into
mathematical formulations of the rates of change and mechanisms described above,
as well as implementing detailed models on refunds and ecalated arbitration.
Stay tuned for a series of publications on this topic in Q2 of this year.

The above results do not indicate any sort of expectations of the future. They
are merely models, and we must remember the golden rule "All models are wrong,
but some are useful." We look forward to progressively collaborating with the
community at large in future iterations of our token engineering iterations for
boson and the dcommerce stack.

### Impact Optimization

The Boson team is currently investigating topics such as optimal protocol fees
for sellers and buyers, and reward mechanisms for supply aggregators. Further
analysis and results will be released in a series of publications in Q2 of this
year.

## Solving dcommerce challenges

**dcommerce challenges** At the core of dcommerce are a set of challenges which
combine operations, game theory, ecosystem value flows and token engineering. It
is possible that this set of problems is intractable, which would mean that
commerce will be forever mediated by humans- with all the cost, trust and
friction that this implies.  However, our research indicates that these problems
can be solved, to a significant extent, by unbundling the services provided by
ecommerce and replacing them with composable decentralized applications and
protocols.  Boson’s core mechanism and despatch modules are examples of these.

**dcommerce research group** We spoke to the token engineering community leads
and agreed to create a research group to attract multi-disciplinary people to
work on hard problems in dcommerce.  This research group will offer funded
bounties for teams to find solutions to problems such as:

- Refunds (via decentralized identity and insurance providers)
- Escalated arbitration (to arbitrators or insurance protocols)
- Quality assessment (via keepers)
- Despatch (enabling buyers to delegate redemption signing)

**dcommerce community outreach**  We will feed this research group with a funnel
of new talent via an industry and academic outreach program.  This outreach
program will incentivize people from specific disciplines such as insurance,
ecommerce and finance to come and work on hard problems in tandem with people
with skills such as token engineering and game theory.

**dcommerce DAO**  Research groups which can apply for funding from the
dCommerce DAO, in order to develop solutions into  dapps or protocols which may
be usefu or valuable to the ecosystem.

**dcommerce accelerator** We are in discussion with Outlier Ventures about
creating a track within their Basecamp accelerator, for dcommerce projects. Such
projects would receive additional grant funding and specialist token, ecosystem,
game theory and dcommerce support from the Boson protocol team.

head of community Alastair Band on LinkedIn to learn more about the
opportunities.
