# Gas fees

Transactions in Ethereum refer to the transfer of message data between accounts
and contracts. The message data can be Ether or contract execution parameters.
Ethereum uses transactions as the smallest unit of execution. Each transaction
includes the following parameters:

- To: The target account address
- Value: The value being transferred can be specified
- Nonce: A transaction-related string used to prevent transactions from being
  replayed
- gasPrice: The price of Gas that is consumed to execute the trade
- gasLimit: The maximum Gas value consumed by the transaction
- Data: The transaction comes with bytecode information that can be used to
  create/invoke smart contracts
- Signature: Signature information

Similar to the Bitcoin network, when sending a transaction, the user has to pay
a certain transaction fee in Ether.

**Gas** refers to the fee, or pricing value, required to successfully conduct a
transaction or execute a contract. Gas fees \*\*are payments made by users to
compensate for the computing energy required to process and validate
transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

**Gas limit** refers to the maximum amount of Gas that you're willing to spend
on a particular transaction. A higher Gas limit means that you must do more work
to execute a transaction using ether or a smart contract.

There are three possible scenarios with which transactions can be created on
chain:

**Gas limit too low** : When the Gas limit is less than the required Gas for
execution of a call, then there is a higher chance for the transaction to get
reverted although the Gas will still be consumed for invoking the function call.
This can also lead to a possible scenario where the transaction is left in a
pending state for a long time. If the actual cost exceeds the supplied Gas, then
the transaction fails with an out-of-Gas exception.

**Ideal Gas limit** : The ideal Gas limit is when a transaction is submitted
with enough Gas limit to cover the costs involved to execute the transaction or
invoke a function call. In order to find the current ideal Gas limits, most
dApps use [ethgasstation](https://ethgasstation.info/)

**Gas limit too high** : Block Gas Limit is the maximum Gas allowed in a block.
Hence each block has a theoretical maximum number of transactions that it can
contain. If there is surplus Gas, it is returned to the sender.

**Gas Price** controls the upper limit of a trade execution order. Each
execution of a contract instruction consumes a fixed amount of cost. When a
transaction has not been executed and the Gas is exhausted, the contract
execution is terminated and rolled back. Gas can be exchanged with Ether. It
should be noted that the price of Ethereum fluctates, but the Gas costs for
executing a certain smart contract can be fixed and adjusted by setting the
price of Gas.

**Gas Optimization:** Smart contract execution cost more Gas than necessary, and
therefore the creators or users will be overcharged. To avoid wasting money,
there are various best-practice programming rules that developers can follow in
Solidity or Vyper.

However in various scenarios the costs involved in executing a transaction on
the Ethereum network can be expensive, no matter how good the code. In order to
avoid this situation, there are various on-chain and off-chain solutions which
can counter issues caused by high Gas prices.

## Ethereum Transactions

There are multiple ways in which we can execute transactions on Ethereum . The
object of sending a transaction is either to transfer an asset or to invoke a
function call in the smart contract. In this document we will discuss various
approaches for creating transactions.

### Simple Transactions

![https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7_FIwNVuOFzCHMI1hHOs1aAD49bs86fLPUxuBJsGQwwYbo1kqXb5-k5o7f_VmmqZNmmT0KU69VzfrJr8GlkiQZFWxgG6peAVvarmLvZ8kddJ5fzJrqK6-ER6Iy7U8nwuKsukEv1e](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7_FIwNVuOFzCHMI1hHOs1aAD49bs86fLPUxuBJsGQwwYbo1kqXb5-k5o7f_VmmqZNmmT0KU69VzfrJr8GlkiQZFWxgG6peAVvarmLvZ8kddJ5fzJrqK6-ER6Iy7U8nwuKsukEv1e)

In simple transactions, the sender invokes a function call on the smart contract
to interact with the contract and execute the transaction. In such transactions,
a significant amount of gas will be used for invoking the smart contract
functions and the rest will be paid as a transaction fee to the miners.

### Delegated Transfers [as in ERC 865] [Mostly used in gasless transfers]

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/97JnBP6K2N2H5knZPGrVhD49o4xREM-fn4GUG-6EHM6i8Wl2j2cw-2FM9SmWXXVgDq-px7oclymBa7uSNNjKRHp5ou93OiQS8nVmVpIL3qXYF8oPN0W0m7XEjDoen6_UAeigxbDS](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/97JnBP6K2N2H5knZPGrVhD49o4xREM-fn4GUG-6EHM6i8Wl2j2cw-2FM9SmWXXVgDq-px7oclymBa7uSNNjKRHp5ou93OiQS8nVmVpIL3qXYF8oPN0W0m7XEjDoen6_UAeigxbDS)

In delegated transfers, the sender will create the signature of the signed
transaction and will send the signature to the delegator. The delegator will pay
for the transaction fee and invoke the transaction. This can further be used for
collecting tokens as payment for the transaction fee which was provided by the
Delegator. Also, we can opt not to charge the users for their transactions.

### Bulk transfers [Mostly used for airdrops]

![https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iSjvB9C1ZsZJrrAD5jh_84AMiqsu41S7sgKXuCBsHrh7osGrDpPajDdZzwd_VNt47n8qChLay2uNU_wPhtF2qaFkE0Y5xdOugu778WPRaFh8jGG4mfC4fjuIDUdtKPiRhYskXKS4](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iSjvB9C1ZsZJrrAD5jh_84AMiqsu41S7sgKXuCBsHrh7osGrDpPajDdZzwd_VNt47n8qChLay2uNU_wPhtF2qaFkE0Y5xdOugu778WPRaFh8jGG4mfC4fjuIDUdtKPiRhYskXKS4)

In bulk transfer, an admin will take a list of the transactions which need to be
transferred to the receiver with the corresponding values to be transferred or
the function to be invoked. The admin then sends the list of transactions to the
bulk sending or airdrop smart contract which will have the capabilities to
execute 300-plus transfers / function calls in a single transaction. Bulk
transfer transactions were widely used during airdrops and token offerings.

### Open Gas Station [Widely used in gasless transactions]

In Open Gas Station, you have to create a relay of your own and set up a
paymaster contract to pay for the transactions. Alternatively you can use the
OpenGSN dApp to collect the user's signature and thereby allow the paymaster's
TrustedForwarder contract to initiate the transfers.

### Using meta data for claims - EIP 712 / Biconomy [Gas subsidization]

Reusable Off-Chain Verifiable Claims enable the issuance of off-chain identity
claims, based on the typed signing capabilities defined in EIP712. The standard
provides an important piece of integrating smart contracts with real world
organizational requirements such as meeting regulatory requirements (KYC, GDPR,
Accredited Investor rules etc). However, it is both dangerous and in some cases
illegal (according to EU GDPR rules for example) to record Identity Claims
containing Personal Identifying Information (PII) on an immutable public
database such as the Ethereum blockchain.

To allow meta transactions to communicate with dApps currently requires paying
Ether for Gas. This limits dApp adoption to people who already own Ether.
Therefore, contract owners may wish to pay Gas on behalf of the user to reduce
friction, or let their users pay for Gas with fiat money or ERC20 tokens. Meta
transactions allow a third party to pay transaction costs on behalf of the user.
Note that while users do not need to own Ether to broadcast such meta
transactions, someone else needs to spend Ether to allow the transaction to be
executed on the network.

Biconomy’s native meta-tx usage:

The generalization of meta transactions responds to the problem of user
onboarding on Ethereum applications.

### What's the problem with Gas ?

As dApp adoption is increasing exponentially, many transactions are made every
second which results in increasing gas prices. Current solutions (based on
client-side wallet applications like Metamask) are perfect from a
decentralization point of view and very easy to integrate into dApps where users
were allowed to choose a flexible Gas price, but in terms of user experience for
non-crypto users, paying higher gas and managing keys is far too complicated.

One way to get around this is to standardize on a meta-tx-relayer API so that:

- Any user can pass their signed message to any standard-abiding relayer
- There is a discovery protocol similar to the one used in Ethereum clients that
  can find many different active relayers so there is always a backup in case
  some go down or fail to run the user-signed message as a transaction
- There is an agreed-upon way to incentivize relayers to run these user-signed
  transactions.

### Drawbacks of Meta Transactions

- Value transfered in meta transactions should always be non-zero (msg.value >
  0).
- Value transfer from EOA (externally owned address) is not possible via meta
  transactions.

For contract interactions which involve ERC20 transfers, meta transactions look
appealing. Boson contracts have not yet incorporated native meta transactions
due to the above drawbacks. However efforts are continually made to make dApps
easier to use. Some of these include implementing new approaches in tackling
high Gas prices so that users spend less of their funds in paying for Gas while
interacting with the Boson contracts. Alternative approaches include subsidizing
Gas payments to an extent.
